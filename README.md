# Hi, I'm Jaeyong Park 🐳

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making an idea a reality, Talking to strangers without feeling awkward, thinking about the organization's common goals together and being motivating when achieving it. Some technologies I enjoy working with include C++, OpenCV, Flutter, NodeJS. After passing two interviews in 2019, I served as an information security specialist at the Cyber Operations Command of the Ministry of National Defense for one year and seven months.
